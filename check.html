        <p>The answer depends on the kind of run you have planned, according to <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/kacie-vavrek" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">Kacie Vavrek, RD</a>, a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics
        and an outpatient dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. If you’re planning on a run that lasts for an hour or longer, it’s helpful to have a pre-workout snack that you tolerate well. That choice is highly individual,
        she adds, and it takes some experimentation to figure out what works for you.</p><p>In general, a snack that has a blend of lean protein and carbohydrates tends to be best, adds Hopkinsville, Kentucky–based dietitian <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-ray-88367882/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">Elizabeth Ray, RDN</a>.
        For example, a small amount of skinless grilled chicken paired with a serving of <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/sweet-potato-nutrition-benefits-recipes-more/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_self">sweet potatoes</a>.

        This means energy isn’t as readily available to your body as the energy you get from quick-digesting carbs.</p><p>Generally, says Vavrek, a snack with quick-digesting carbs like a banana or a bagel works well, provided you had a regular meal about four hours beforehand. If you’re <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/running/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_self">running</a> first thing
        in the morning, just the snack is probably enough.</p><p>“It really is variable, because some people can eat a huge meal right before a run and they’re fine, while others definitely can’t do that,” she adds. “Keeping a log of what you eat and how you felt on your run is the best
        way to figure it out for yourself.”</p>
        <h3>Is Carb Loading Still a Thing? Should I Consider It?</h3>
        <p>The theory behind loading up on carbs is that they fill the body with energy so you can maximize your performance, usually about 12 hours before a big run. For example, some runners swear by eating pasta the night before a race and may eat more white bread, rice, and starchy foods the week leading up to the race, says Ray.</p>

You’ll see inflammation, poor digestion, energy slumps, and mood swings as a result.”</p><p><a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-199724020-00001" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">Research</a> has shown that carb loading may delay fatigue and improve performance by 2 to 3 percent during endurance events lasting longer than 90 minutes. However, after analyzing 24 randomized, controlled trials, the authors of a <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-016-0139-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">review in the <em>Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition</em></a> concluded that there isn't enough data to support the perks of carb loading in most people besides the male endurance cyclists studied.</p><p>Instead of carb loading, Ray suggests focusing on balanced meals made of <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/carbohydrates/guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_self">carbohydrates</a>, protein, and <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/101/nutrition-basics/skinny-on-fat.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_self">fat</a>. Balanced meals do more for your energy levels than a huge bowl of pasta, says Ray.</p><p>It’s also important to include sufficient carbs in your meals to maintain muscle glycogen stores (glycogen is the stored form of carbohydrates). Running requires plenty of glycogen. If you don’t have enough, your running performance and recovery may suffer, according to a <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019055/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">review</a>.</p><p>Your carbohydrate requirements may vary, but aim for carbs to make up about 50 to 70 percent of your daily calories, per the <a class="cr-anchor cr-anchor--mounted" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/joggers-eat-drink-and-be-healthy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic</a>.</p></div>
