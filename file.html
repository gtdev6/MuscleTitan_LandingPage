			Sore muscles are one of the less pleasant side effects of exercise. Depending on the type and
			intensity of the workout, muscle soreness after a workout can range from barely noticeable to
			extremely painful.

		<h2>Why Do Our Muscles Get Sore in the First Place?</h2>

		<p>
			Muscle soreness after exercise (also referred to as delayed-onset muscle soreness, or DOMS)
			signals that you caused damage to your muscle tissue, according to the American College of
			Sports Medicine (ACSM). When this damage, or micro-tearing, happens, your body initiates the
			repair process by triggering inflammation at the injured site, says Shawn Arent, PhD, CSCS, a
			professor and the chair in the department of exercise science at the University of South
			Carolina in Columbia and the director of its sports science lab.
		</p>

		<p>
			Fluid accumulates in the muscles, putting extra pressure on the damaged areas, leading to that
			familiar sensation of tightness and pain that typically begins to develop 12 to 24 hours after
			your workout, Dr. Arent says.
		</p>

		<p>
			While you create a little bit of damage every time you exercise, certain types of workouts are
			notorious for higher levels of damage and — by extension — soreness. In particular, any workout
			that’s new to you, more intense than usual, or involves a lot of eccentric movements will likely
			cause more damage and muscle soreness than other types of workouts.
